# React + Vite Project

This is a simple React application powered by Vite. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Once inside the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

### 3. Start the development server

To start the Vite development server and run the application, execute:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the project.

### 4. Build for production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist/` directory containing the production-ready code.

### 5. Preview the production build

To preview the production build locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build on a local server.
